1. Login to drought via putty.
   
2. Start 'screen' by typing
        screen -D -R
   
3. Give the command
        cd DIR
   where DIR is the absolute pathname of the directory containing the
   files you want to combine into a time series.  For example:
        cd '/flood/MODIS/CONUS NDVI/2000/WebMercator'
   Be sure to enclose the pathname in quotes if it contains spaces
   
4. Give a command like the following
        /var/www/html/timeseries/buildts -D /var/www/html/timeseries -o OUTPUTNAME *.img
   to create the time series.  Replace OUTPUTNAME with the name you
   want to use for this particular time series, for example, something
   like "2006ConusNDVI".  The last argument, '*.img", is a wildcard
   argument that means include every file in the current directory
   that ends with the suffix ".img".  Adjust accordingly.
   
5. If the command takes a long time, you can leave your putty session by
   simply killing the window (click on the 'x' in the upper right
   cornder), and return to it later by repeating steps 1 and 2 above.

6. To test the resulting time series once it is finished, go to a browser
   and enter the following URL
	   http://www3.nemac.unca.edu/timeseries/graph.cgi?args=OUTPUTNAME,-8359100,5105590
   where OUTPUTNAME is the name you chose in step 4 above.  You should see a graph appear,
   although you might have to pan/zoom along the horizontal (time)
   access before you actually see any data

7. The URL that Todd needs for creating these graphs from within the mashup is:
	   http://www3.nemac.unca.edu/timeseries/tsmugl.cgi?args=OUTPUTNAME,x,y
